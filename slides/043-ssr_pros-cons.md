Note: 
- infrastructure can handle requests and the servers are able to scale as traffic grows
- call to server each time and loading everything on demand will give slower UX flow
- SSR sites are harder to keep secure because they have a bigger surface to attack than CSR sites
- configuring cache is usually more complex
- SSR often needs a bigger and more powerful server to provide high-performance than CSR
- SSR sites tend to get a high latency (ping rate), so if there is a lot of traffic at the same time, it will slow down the browsing experience for everyone
