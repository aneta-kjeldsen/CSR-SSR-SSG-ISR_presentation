- no personalisation and dynamic content <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
- rebuild to see changes <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

Note:
- personalisation and dynamic content require workarounds or additional services

- when site reaches certain size, the build time might be quite huge, some workflows might not even be able to handle building 1 mil. blog-post pages
